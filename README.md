# Glance Watch Face for Fitbit Versa 2

An experimental watch face for my Fitbit Versa 2. No promises.

## Fitbit SDK

Versa 2 is an older device which runs Fitbit OS 4.x. Install Fitbit SDK with the following command:

    npm i @fitbit/sdk@4.2.1

### Fitbit SDK documentation

The official Fitbit SDK documentation is always at the latest version, which in my view is not developer friendly. The official (ridiculous) advice is to use the Internet Wayback Machine:
